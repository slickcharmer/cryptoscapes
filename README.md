## ‚≠ê  About this Website
This project started out from a few skills I wanted to learn and practice over my summer break from college, most notably the state management library, [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [atomic design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#:~:text=Atomic%20design%20is%20atoms%2C%20molecules,parts%20at%20the%20same%20time.), and project management.

After tinkering with a bunch of cryptocurrency data with Redux, I eventually decided to create a simple UI to display this data, through the use of charts and heatmaps. Some of the visualisations seen also involve further manipulation of the data, such as the [heatmap](https://cryptoscapes.org/trends) displaying metric correlations between cryptocurrencies. 

The result was Cryptoscapes, an information dashboard that displays prices, trends, status updates, market snapshots and much more. Visit the website at [cryptoscapes.org](https://cryptoscapes.org) to check it out!
